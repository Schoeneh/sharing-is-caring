This desgin features a quote by [Yevgeny Yevtushenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Yevtushenko)'s poem '[Babi Yar](https://remember.org/witness/babiyar)' (1961).  
The Russian text stems from [rupoem.ru](https://rupoem.ru/evtushenko/nad-babim-yarom.aspx); I tweaked existing translations to better fit the tone I was going for.  
The image in the lower right corner is based on [a stamp from 1934 Mandatory Palestine](https://web.archive.org/web/20230807024504/https://forward.com/news/448022/antifa-yiddish-zionist/).
